# QAC241-Network-Analysis

For this project, I analyzed passing networks in NBA games. The goal was to see if certain styles
of play as described by assist networks and metrics about those networks corresponded to winning
or losing.

I included scripts for scraping/cleaning/prepping the data as well as the raw data in json files.
The final paper gives a more thorough breakdown of the project and its results.
